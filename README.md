# Credit-Risk-Modeling

In this project, I explored and cleanse a dataset consisting of over 111,000 loan records to determine the best way to predict whether a loan applicant will fully repay or default on a loan. Then I build a machine learning model that returns the unique loan ID and a loan status label that indicates whether the loan will be fully paid or charged off.
